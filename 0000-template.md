# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Basic example

If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example.
Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with Babel to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider:

- implementation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
- whether the proposed feature can be implemented in user space
- the impact on teaching people Babel
- integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
- cost of migrating existing Babel applications (is it a breaking change?)

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Alternatives

What other designs have been considered? Why did you decide against those? What is the impact of not doing this?

This section should also include prior art, such as whether similar projects have already implemented a similar feature.

# Adoption strategy

If we implement this proposal, how will existing users adopt it? Is
this a breaking change? How will we minimize disruption to existing users? 
Can we write a codemod? Should we coordinate with
other projects or libraries?

# How we teach this

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this
idea best presented?

Would the acceptance of this proposal mean our documentation must be
re-organized or altered? Does it change how Babel is used by developers
at any level?

How should this feature be taught to existing users?

# Open questions

<!--
    This section is optional, but is suggested for a first draft.

    What parts of this proposal are you unclear about? What do you
    need to know before you can finalize this RFC?

    List the questions that you'd like reviewers to focus on. When
    you've received the answers and updated the design to reflect them, 
    you can remove this section.
    
    If you plan to implement this on your own, what help would you need from the team?
